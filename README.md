Mikkelâ€™s Dotfiles in Git
========================

As I ~~recently~~ (in 2009) discovered, keeping your dotfiles in git is one of
the neatest tricks since sliced bread. Much has changed since then, so now I
use [chezmoi][] to manage my dotfiles.

Feel free to use these dotfiles for inspiration or any other purpose.

To use these dotfiles:

1. Install `chezmoi`.
2. Run `chezmoi init --apply mikl`
3. Enjoy.
